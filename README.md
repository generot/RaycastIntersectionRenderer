# RaycastIntersectionRenderer
In short, this application uses the Line-Line intersection theorem to determine whether the FOV(made up of rays) intersects with a map piece and if it does, it draws the map piece on the screen. The SFML Graphics library is being used by the project(the Visual C++ 2017 version) so if you want to compile it on your own, you have to use MSVC 2017(although 2019 works as well and infact, this is the version I used to compile it).
